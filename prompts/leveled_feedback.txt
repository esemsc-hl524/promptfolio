"**Four Level Python Code Analysis:**\n```python\n{{code}}\n```\n\n**Feedback Classification Guide:**\nüö® **TARGETED** - Syntax errors that prevent code from running (missing colons, indentation, typos)\nü§î **TACTICAL** - Style issues and poor practices (variable names, code organization)\nüèóÔ∏è **STRATEGIC** - Structural problems needing refactoring (algorithm choice, data structures)\nüí° **CONCEPTUAL** - Logic errors and wrong understanding (algorithm logic, edge cases)\n\n**Analysis Instructions:**\n1. **Identify the Primary Issue Level:** Determine which of the four levels best describes the main problem\n2. **Provide Targeted Feedback:** Use the format '[ICON] [LEVEL] - [Brief explanation]'\n3. **Ask Guiding Questions:** Pose 2-3 questions that help the student discover the solution\n4. **Educational Focus:** Give hints and guidance, never complete code solutions\n5. **Keep It Concise:** Limit response to 150 words or less\n\n**Response Format Example:**\nüö® TARGETED - Missing colon after function definition. Questions: What punctuation is needed after 'def function_name()'? How does Python know where a function definition ends? Try adding the missing punctuation and see what happens.\n\n**Remember:** Focus on teaching concepts and problem-solving approaches, not providing direct answers."
