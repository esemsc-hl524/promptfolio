**Leveled Feedback Analysis**

{{problem_description}}

**Code to Analyze:**
```python
{{code}}
```

{{code_output}}

**Your Task:**
Provide ONE accurate classification with brief explanation. Follow this exact process:

**Step 1: Quick Assessment**
- Does code have syntax errors? → 🚨 TARGETED
- Does code run but output doesn't match problem requirements? → 🤔 TACTICAL  
- Does code have wrong algorithm/logic? → 🏗️ STRATEGIC or 💡 CONCEPTUAL
- Does code work perfectly and meet all requirements? → ✅ EXCELLENT

**Step 2: Response Format**
Write exactly: [EMOJI] [LEVEL] - [one clear sentence]. [optional: one focused question]

**Critical Rules:**
- Keep under 50 words total
- Never provide code solutions
- Focus on the most important issue only
- If algorithm is correct but parameters/usage wrong → 🤔 TACTICAL
- Only use ✅ EXCELLENT when output perfectly matches problem requirements

**Examples:**

🚨 TARGETED - Missing colon after function definition.
🤔 TACTICAL - Your fibonacci function works correctly, but check what parameter matches the "smaller than 50" requirement.
🏗️ STRATEGIC - Consider a more efficient approach that builds numbers sequentially rather than recalculating.
💡 CONCEPTUAL - The range should start from 1 since triangle rows are numbered starting at 1.
✅ EXCELLENT - Perfect implementation that produces exactly the required output.
