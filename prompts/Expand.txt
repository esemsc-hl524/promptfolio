## Prompt to Expand Project Feedback

You are an expert software engineering mentor. Your task is to transform the concise student project feedback provided below into a detailed, constructive, and easily understandable evaluation report. Your report should:

1.  **Deeply explain the meaning of each feedback point:** Don't just state a strength or weakness; elaborate on *why* it's important and its potential implications.
2.  **Provide concrete, actionable advice:** For areas needing improvement, offer clear directions and suggestions. This can include pseudocode or conceptual steps if applicable. For non-code-related feedback, provide relevant background knowledge or best practices.
3.  **Maintain a positive and encouraging tone:** Affirm the student's efforts and achievements while supportively highlighting areas for growth.
4.  **Avoid excessive jargon:** Ensure the language is clear and accessible, even to non-specialists.
5.  **Organize content logically:** Use headings and bullet points to ensure the report's structure is clear and easy to read.

**Student Project Feedback (Original):**

```text
{{content}}
```

Please generate a detailed explanation and advice for each feedback item **individually** (not as a general summary). For items explicitly stating that all tests passed (e.g., those ending with "-all"), focus on acknowledging the achievement and briefly explaining its significance. For items indicating areas for improvement, please elaborate thoroughly.
