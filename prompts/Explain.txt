Your explanation should include:
1. **What does this feedback mean?** – Rephrase it in simple, student-friendly language;
2. **Why might the teacher say this?** – Briefly explain the likely reasoning or learning objective behind the feedback;
3. **What should the student do about it?** – Offer practical, actionable suggestions the student can follow;
4. **What if the student doesn't understand or agree?** – Suggest a polite and constructive way to follow up with the teacher.

Guidelines:
- Avoid academic jargon where possible;
- Keep the tone supportive, clear, and non-judgmental;
- If helpful, give a brief example or analogy to aid understanding;
- If the feedback is vague or lacks detail, say so and suggest how the student can ask for clarification.

Your goal is to reduce confusion and help the student feel empowered to take the next step.
