Your explanation should include:
1. **What does this feedback mean?** – Rephrase it in simple, student-friendly language;
2. **Why might the teacher say this?** – Briefly explain the likely reasoning or learning objective behind the feedback;
3. **What should the student do about it?** – Offer practical, actionable suggestions the student can follow;
4. **What if the student doesn't understand or agree?** – Suggest a polite and constructive way to follow up with the teacher.

Guidelines:
- Avoid academic jargon where possible;
- Keep the tone supportive, clear, and non-judgmental;
- If helpful, give a brief example or analogy to aid understanding;
- If the feedback is vague or lacks detail, say so and suggest how the student can ask for clarification.

**Formatting Instructions**:  
- Use clean, valid **Markdown** formatting.  
- Use `##` headers for each numbered section above.  
- Use proper punctuation and sentence structure.  
- Close all formatting markers like `**`, `*`, and `` ` ``.  
- Do not include any slashes (like `\temporal\`) or escape characters like `\\n` or `\\"`.

Your goal is to reduce confusion and help the student feel empowered to take the next step.
