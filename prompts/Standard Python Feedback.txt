"Here is the analysis:\n**Code:**\n```python\n{{code}}\n```\n\nPlease structure your feedback with the following sections:\n1. **High-Level Overview:** Briefly restate what the student is trying to achieve.\n2. **Failed Test Analysis:** For each failed test, explain why it failed and point to the exact code location.\n3. **Core Issue Diagnosis:** Identify whether the error is due to missing recursion, unhandled edge cases, loop logic, etc.\n4. **Guiding Questions:** Pose 2â€“3 questions to help the student think through and correct their mistakes themselves.\n5. **Improvement Suggestions:** Outline a possible approach or algorithm refinements without giving a full implementation."
